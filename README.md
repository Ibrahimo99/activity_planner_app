# Activity Planner Application

The application allows the user to define their own training schedule for each week. Users of the
application can also record their actual achievements. These training goals and achievements are
private, i.e. they are only visible to this logged in user.
The properties of a weekly training plan can be designed by you but should at least consist of:
* The dates of the week*.
 A breakdown of the exercise goals for this week. There should be at least three fitness goals
for each week, but more can be added.
 The actual achievements against the goals.
The activity planner application should provide the following core functionality:
 Training goals can be added.
 Training goals can be removed.
 Training goals can be modified.
 Training goals can be defined for several weeks ahead.
 Actual training achievements can be recorded at the time they occur, e.g. training goals can
be ticked off or actual times or number of repetitions can be recorded.
 Users are able to see a listing of all incomplete training goals together with the week for
which they were planned.
 Users should be able to share a weekly plan with other users by sending a link to a week’s
training schedule. You can assume that anyone who has the link has permission to see that
week’s goals and/or achievements.
